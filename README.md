# PMA23

This repository is managed by the students of group PMA23 at Lviv National University named after Ivan Franko. The group primarily works with Python for their projects and assignments. Each student has a designated folder in the main branch named after their first name and last name, where they store all their completed Python tasks and projects. Additionally, each student has their own branch where they can work individually on Python-related tasks.

### Working on Your Python Tasks

1. Create a new branch using the format: `name_lastname`.
2. Work on your Python tasks and projects in this branch.
3. Push your changes to your branch regularly.
4.  When you have completed your Python tasks, make sure to merge them into the main branch.
